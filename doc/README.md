This is the official repository of Login Cidadão Documentation. Here, you can find docs about installation, maintenance mode and procedures of [Projeto Login Cidadão](https://github.com/PROCERGS/login-cidadao).

All documents here were generated with mkdocs.

2 - In localhost plus default door (http://127.0.0.1:8000) you can reach the docs site. If you want to make some changes, mkdocs will be able to show automaticaly.

## Building html/css/js

1 - To deploy the docs into a html struture, let's build the documentation. Is very simple. In the zup-docs directory, run mkdocs build:

```
$ mkdocs build
```

This will create a new directory, named site. Let's take a look inside the directory:

```
  user@Server:~/zup-docs$ ls -la site/

```

After some time, files may be removed from the documentation but they will still reside in the site directory. To remove those stale files, just run mkdocs with the --clean switch.

```
$ mkdocs build --clean
```
